# Xmer Network Analysis

Welcome to the **Xmer Network Analysis** pipeline! This repository provides tools and scripts for analyzing sequences, extracting x-mers, clustering, and visualizing results as a network graph.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/BrockBakke/xmer-network-analysis.git
   cd xmer-network-analysis
   ```

2. **Restore the R environment**:
   Install R packages using `renv`:
   ```r
   renv::restore()
   ```

3. **Ensure required system dependencies are installed**:
   - GPU drivers are needed for `gpuR` (if GPU computation is enabled).
   - Other dependencies are specified in `scripts/00_setup_environment.R`.

### Modifying Parameters

Adjust key parameters in `scripts/00_setup_environment.R` as needed:
- `fasta_file`: Path to your input FASTA file.
- `xmer_l`: Length of the x-mers (default: 9).
- `unique_threshhold`: Minimum number of sequences an x-mer must appear in.

---

### Running the Pipeline

Execute the entire pipeline with:
```r
source("scripts/run_analysis.R")
```

To customize the workflow:
1. Modify parameters in `scripts/00_setup_environment.R`.
2. Run specific steps by sourcing the corresponding scripts in the `scripts/` directory.
